# Mocks Parser

This mock parser is identical in functionality as the original parser. 

The difference is that the mock parser reads scripts from the mocks folder (generated by the `mocks-script.ps1` in the tools folder) instead of the scripts folder.

See the tools folder for more information on generating the mocks folder.
