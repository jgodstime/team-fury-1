# Mocks Script

This powershell script can be used to create a specified number of mock script files that will be stored in the mocks folder in the root directory.

## How To

1. Navigate to this folder using a terminal that can run powershell scripts.

2. Run the script:
`.\mocks-script.ps1 <count>`

The count variable is 400 by default but you can replace it with any number you want.

The script will then run and create <count> amount of files in the mocks folder.
